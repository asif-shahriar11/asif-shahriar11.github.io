Hi! My name is Asif Shahriar, but you can call me Asif. I am currently working as a Lecturer in the [CSE department](https://cse.sds.bracu.ac.bd/) of [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/). I completed my B.Sc. in CSE from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) in 2024. During my junior year, I completed a hybrid internship at North West Power Generation Company Limited, where I helped develop a machine learning algorithm for predicting `faulty ultrasonic flow-meters`. My current research interests span across computer security, Adversarial ML, natural language processing, and Trustworthy LLMs. Alongside raw-performance improvement, I also value `efficiency`, `modularity`, and `trustworthiness` _(we do not work with someone we do not know, why should it be any different for the technology we use?)_.

My undergrad thesis was on using LLMs for identifying vulnerabilities from 5G specifications using `zero-shot` and `in-context` learning, which has been published in [IEEE TIFS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072222). Currently I am working on `cross-modal vulnerabilities` and `secured agentic frameworks`.


I am grateful to all the mentors and supervisors who have guided and supported me throughout my academic and research journey. I believe in _“persistence until improvement”_, even if it requires going the extra mile – and hopes my students would, too.
