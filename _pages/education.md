My undergrad CGPA is a strictly increasing function of time (semesters). Maybe someday I will write that story. Just for fun, here is a graph that shows my CGPA at each semester, starting from 1-1 up to 4-2.

  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, 3-2, 4-1, 4-2],
      "y": [3.55, 3.75, 3.77, 3.81, 3.81, 3.83, 3.85],
      "type": "scatter"
    },
  ]
}
