Hi! My name is Asif Shahriar, but you can call me Asif. I am currently working as a Lecturer in the [CSE department](https://cse.sds.bracu.ac.bd/) of [BRAC University](https://www.bracu.ac.bd/). I completed my B.Sc. in CSE from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/) in 2024. During my junior year, I completed a hybrid internship at North West Power Generation Company Limited, where I helped develop a machine learning algorithm for predicting faulty ultrasonic flow-meters. My current research interests span across `Computer security`, `Adversarial ML`, `Natural language processing`, and `Trustworthy AI`. Alongside raw-performance improvement, I also value **efficiency**, **modularity**, and **trustworthiness** _(we do not work with someone we do not trust, why should it be any different for the technology we use?)_.

My undergrad thesis was on using LLMs for identifying vulnerabilities from 5G specifications through a combination of **zero-shot** and **in-context** learning, which has been published in [IEEE TIFS](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072222). I also developed an inception-style multi-scale feature extraction framework for enhancing the contextual representations of _**any**_ encoder transformer model, which has been accepted for presentation in the main conference of [EMNLP 2025](https://2025.emnlp.org/) Currently I am working on `cross-modal vulnerabilities` and `secured agentic frameworks`.


I am grateful to all the mentors and supervisors who have guided and supported me throughout my academic and research journey. I believe in _“persistence until improvement”_, even if it requires going the extra mile – and hope my students would, too.
