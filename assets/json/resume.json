We discovered that out-of-the-box GPT-4 has impressive capabilities in flagging ogical inconsistencies and procedural flaws, but it also hallucinates, provides false positives, and struggles to detect deep protocol issues. To remedy this, we teach GPT-4 to think like a telecom-security expertâ€“ what properties must hold, how they fail, and how hazards indicators are exploited by adversaries. The result is a scalable, powerful, efficient black-box framework that can uncover subtle, protocol-level attack vectors that would otherwise slip through the cracks."},{"name":"Inceptive Transformers: Enhancing Contextual Representations through Multi-Scale Feature Learning Across Domains and Languages","publisher":"Proceedings of EMNLP 2025 [To appear]","releaseDate":"2025","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20496","summary":"A modular, lightweight, plug-and-play architecture for enhancing the contextual representations of any encoder model.
